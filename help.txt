Objectives and Outcomes
In this exercise you will download and install MongoDB on your computer. You will then start a MongoDB server and interact with it using the Mongo REPL shell. At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

Download and Installing MongoDB

Start the server and interact with it using the Mongo REPL shell

Downloading and Installing MongoDB
Go to http://www.mongodb.org, then download and install MongoDB as per the instructions given there.

Create a folder named mongodb on your computer and create a subfolder under it named data.

Move to the mongodb folder and then start the MongoDB server by typing the following at the prompt:

1
     mongod --dbpath=data --bind_ip 127.0.0.1
Open another command window and then type the following at the command prompt to start the mongo REPL shell:

1
     mongo
The Mongo REPL shell will start running and give you a prompt to issue commands to the MongoDB server. At the Mongo REPL prompt, type the following commands one by one and see the resulting behavior:

1234
     db
     use conFusion
     db
     db.help()
You will now create a collection named dishes, and insert a new dish document in the collection:

1
     db.dishes.insert({ name: "Uthappizza", description: "Test" });
Then to print out the dishes in the collection, type:

1
     db.dishes.find().pretty();
Note the "_id" assigned to the dish.

Next, we will learn the information encoded into the ObjectId by typing the following at the prompt:

12
     var id = new ObjectId();
     id.getTimestamp();
Type "exit" at the REPL prompt to exit the Mongo REPL.

Conclusions
In this exercise, you learnt to download and install MongoDB. Then you started the MongoDB server and interacted with it using the Mongo REPL shell.
